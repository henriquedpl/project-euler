# Introduction

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is an online platform that contains around one thousand problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The problems present an interesting intersection between mathematics and algorithms, providing challenges that span various domains in both fields. The platform also offers a collaborative forum where enthusiasts from all around the world share their thoughts and solutions (a discussion for a particular problem becomes available once the problem is solved).

I have a bachelor degree in computer science and, back when I was a student, I started solving these problems but they quickly progress into something that requires more mathematical knowledge than I had back then. Now that I am pursuing a degree in math, I re-discovered this challenge and once more started to work on the problems. I'll try to solve them all, but I am not sure how far I'll get.

# Requirements

 - Python (I use python 3.10.9)
